# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience
* Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community
* Supporting fellow contributors in learning and improving their skills
* Recognizing and appreciating the contributions of all community members
* Maintaining professional and respectful discourse in all communications

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission
* Dismissive or condescending behavior toward others' questions or contributions
* Claiming others' work as your own or failing to provide proper attribution
* Violating intellectual property rights, including reproducing copyrighted specifications
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Engineering-Specific Standards

Given the technical nature of this project, we also expect:

### Technical Collaboration
* **Constructive Code Review**: Provide specific, actionable feedback focused on code quality and standards compliance
* **Evidence-Based Discussion**: Support technical opinions with references to standards (AES3-2009, IEEE, ISO/IEC)
* **Teaching Mindset**: Help others understand complex concepts rather than simply asserting correctness
* **Graceful Error Handling**: Everyone makes mistakes; focus on learning and improvement

### Standards Compliance
* **Respect Copyright**: Never reproduce copyrighted specification text in contributions
* **Cite Sources**: Reference AES3-2009 sections and standards without reproducing content
* **Original Work**: Ensure all contributions are your own work or properly attributed
* **License Compliance**: Follow MIT License terms for all contributions

### Quality and Testing
* **Test-Driven Development**: Follow TDD practices (write tests first)
* **No Breaking Changes**: Respect the test suite; ensure all tests pass
* **Documentation**: Document technical decisions and complex implementations
* **Peer Review**: Accept that all code requires review before merging

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, including:

* GitHub repository (issues, pull requests, discussions)
* Code commits and commit messages
* Documentation and comments
* Community forums and chat channels
* Project-related events (virtual or in-person)
* Social media when representing the project

This Code of Conduct also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Alpha Phase Considerations

During the Alpha testing phase, we especially value:

* **Honest Feedback**: Report bugs and issues without fear of criticism
* **Failed Tests Welcome**: Negative results are valuable data for validation
* **Learning Together**: Alpha is for discovery; questions and confusion are expected
* **Patience**: Maintainers may be overwhelmed during Alpha; be patient with response times
* **Realistic Expectations**: Understand this is Alpha software with known limitations

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at:

**[Contact Email - To be determined]**

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

### 1. Correction

**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

### 2. Warning

**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series of actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.

### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

### 4. Permanent Ban

**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the community.

## Technical Dispute Resolution

For technical disagreements (not conduct violations):

1. **Discuss with Evidence**: Support positions with references to AES3-2009 or other standards
2. **Seek Consensus**: Work toward agreement through collaborative discussion
3. **Escalate if Needed**: Bring unresolved disputes to project maintainers
4. **Accept Decisions**: Once maintainers decide, respect the decision and move forward
5. **Document Learning**: Record rationale in ADRs (Architecture Decision Records) for future reference
